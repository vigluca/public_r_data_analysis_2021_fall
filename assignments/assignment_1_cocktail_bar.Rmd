# Skills needed to solve this assignment

-   Using R and RStudio, reading data
-   Reporting using RMarkdown
-   Using Git and Github (for submitting the task)
-   Data manipulation (e.g. dplyr, tidyr)
-   String manipulation (e.g. stringr)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```

# Background

Your Cuban uncle sets up a cocktail bar in downtown Budapest. He has a secret list of cocktails that he would like to serve in the bar. He asks you to do create a few lists and tables to set up the shop. As your uncle is a secret hipster, he has a dataset on Github that you can use for the task!

Note: There are several different ways to solve these tasks, feel free to come up with your own.

## 1. Read the data

Read the cocktail dataset from: <https://github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance> You can also find the codebook there.

```{r}

cocktails <- read_tsv("https://raw.github.com/nthun/cocktail-balance/master/cocktail_data.tsv")
cols(
  name = col_character(),
  abv = col_double(),
  acid = col_double(),
  sugar = col_double(),
  type = col_character(),
  index = col_double(),
  instructions = col_character(),
  ingredients = col_factor(),
  ncotw = col_character()
)


head(cocktails)
```

## 2. Transform the data table and clean the ingredient variable!

The ingredients are currently in a single cell for each cocktail. It would be better to put them in separate rows. Also, the variable should be cleaned of all quantities (e.g. 1/2 oz, 2 dashes, etc.), and the indicator of alcohol content (e.g. 47.3% abv). You will need to use this cleaned table in later tasks.

```{r}


cocktails_try<-cocktails%>%mutate(ingredients=str_replace_all(string=ingredients,c("oz" ="", "(%)"="", "abv"="", '[[:digit:]]+'="", "( )"="")))

cocktails_sep<-separate(cocktails_try, col="ingredients", into=c("ing_1", "ing_2", "ing_3", "ing_4", "ing_5", "ing_6"), sep="<br/>")  

cocktails_sep_new<-cocktails_sep %>%mutate("ing_1"=str_replace_all(string=ing_1, pattern='[^[:alnum:]]',replacement = ""))
cocktails_sep_new2<-cocktails_sep_new %>%mutate("ing_2"=str_replace_all(string=ing_2, pattern='[^[:alnum:]]',replacement = ""))
cocktails_sep_new3<-cocktails_sep_new2 %>%mutate("ing_3"=str_replace_all(string=ing_3, pattern='[^[:alnum:]]',replacement = ""))
cocktails_sep_new4<-cocktails_sep_new3 %>%mutate("ing_4"=str_replace_all(string=ing_4, pattern='[^[:alnum:]]',replacement = ""))
cocktails_sep_new5<-cocktails_sep_new4 %>%mutate("ing_5"=str_replace_all(string=ing_5, pattern='[^[:alnum:]]',replacement = ""))
cocktails_sep_final<-cocktails_sep_new5 %>%mutate("ing_6"=str_replace_all(string=ing_6, pattern='[^[:alnum:]]',replacement = ""))



cocktails_united<-cocktails_sep_final%>%unite(ingredients,c("ing_1", "ing_2", "ing_3", "ing_4", "ing_5", "ing_6"), sep=",", remove = TRUE, na.rm = TRUE)
glimpse(cocktails_united)
cocktails_factors<-cocktails_united%>% mutate_if(is.character, as.factor)

str(cocktails_factors)

```

## 3. All ingredients in alphabetical order

Before opening the bar, you need to find a reliable supplier that has all the ingredients. You need to send a list of all possible ingredients you will need. They don't need the quantities (i.e. how many of these are needed), just the names of the ingredients.

```{r}
levels(cocktails_factors$ingredients)
```

## 4. Number of unique ingredients

How many different ingredients you will need?

```{r}

```

## 5. What are the top 10 ingredients?

What are the 10 most frequently used ingredients? If there are ties, you can list more than 10.

```{r}

```

## 6. Which cocktail(s) has/have the most ingredients?

Count the number of ingredients and filter all the cocktails that has that many.

```{r}

```

## 7. How many ingredients appear in only one cocktail (rare ingredient)?

Count all cocktails with only one ingredient, and

```{r}

```

## 8. Which cocktail has an ingredient that is only used in one cocktail?

```{r}

```

## 9. What are the cocktails without rare ingredients?

```{r}
  
```

## 10. Create a cheat sheet for the bartender!

Create a matrix that shows all cocktail names as rows and all ingredients as columns. When a cocktail requires an ingredient, there should be an "X" in the cell, otherwise, the cell should remain empty. Example:

```{r}

```

```{r}

```

Congrats, the bar is now officially open!
